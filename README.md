## Code Example

## Installation

The recommendation is to use python venv to set up a virtual enviornment and activating it.

    > python3 -m venv env
    > source env/bin/activate
   
Then you can install the python modules.

    > pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## How to use?

main.py takes a couple of command line arguments to make setting up the database easy.

If you'd like to set up the database you can use the `--init` flag.

    > python3 main.py --init
    
After making any changes to the DB and you can dump the current tables first with the `--init-clean` flag.
   
    > python3 main.py --init-clean

Other flags allow you to populate the database with test data with the `--populate-test-data` flag. `--only` flag will run all commands but not start the flask server.

Finally if you want make changes to the GraphQL data model you can run with `--dump-graphql-schema` to generate the js schema.
